## Unreleased

- **`firstPerKey` / `topNPerGroup` materialized queries (BL-187).** Schema apply and HTTP create. `firstPerKey` is MIN of `orderBy`, not arrival order. `topNPerGroup` maintains at most N rows per group; working set is in-memory (use a compact per-key source). Query the result table by name. [Schema management](guides/schema-management.md#materialized-queries-in-the-schema-file), [Materialized queries](guides/materialized.md).
- **P38 — Freshness and replica consistency.** New [Freshness](guides/freshness.md) guide: one 42-hex consistency token (`AtLeast`, not `AsOf`), `GET /api/databases/{db}/token`, named-query alias `freshness`, SDK store (`consistencyTokenStore` / `IConsistencyTokenStore`). HTTP API v2.4: `X-Aouda-Token` / `?at_least=` (query wins), `TOKEN_*` / `FRESHNESS_*` errors, stream `token` alongside `version`, bulk-load commit field `walPosition` → `token`. **Breaking:** `MaxLagSeconds` is measured staleness, not lag-bytes ÷ 1 MB/s. Caveats are first-class: scale-out in-memory store (gate 13), clock skew, `w:1` → `TOKEN_EPOCH_SUPERSEDED`, MQ watermark, token volume leak, blocking `waitMs` (default 250), Hub CP-B4 not shipped. Default read preference remains `Primary`.
- **Local CLI testing for agents.** New [Local CLI testing (agents)](ai/local-cli-testing.md): throwaway `aouda start` recipe (unused ports, temp `--data-dir`, pin CLI, stop with `-s`), plus engine/CLI traps — `aouda start -h` boots on `:5000` into `./data`; data-plane executes named-query hashes (not `POST /query`); `CorsOrigins` is one string; schema `partitionKey` / `where.and` / `offset` cap; columnar bodies; keys returned once. [Direct client access](guides/direct-client-access.md) CORS example corrected from a JSON array to a string. Linked from [llms.txt](llms.txt), [AI quick start](ai/quick-start.md), and [AI Agents](ai/index.md).
- **P40 complete (server 0.1.9).** Browser-tier named queries can carry a product: watchlist subscribe with `in`, throttled last-price (`collapse_inserts` / `latestPerKey` with `prev`), candle chart over `outputName` columns, paged screener with `totalMatches` and `whenParamPresent`, server-side top-gainers via computed MQ output. [Completion report](https://github.com/aoudadb/aouda/blob/main/docs/tasks/P40-COMPLETION.md). Compatible `@aouda/client` **0.1.14**; Studio pin unchanged (**0.0.18** / **0.1.13**). See [Compatibility](clients/compatibility.md).
- **P40 S09 — Market-data guide rewrite and browser-tier conformance fixture.** The [Market data guide](guides/market-data.md) is rewritten around a browser-tier caller using `mk_pub_*`. Published conformance fixture at `examples/p40-browser-tier/` (`aouda.schema.json`, `seed.json`, `expected.json`) demonstrates watchlist subscribe, `latestPerKey` last-price, candle chart via `outputName`, paged screener, and top-gainers ranking — all via `schema/apply` with zero imperative catalog calls.
- **P40 S04–S08 capabilities added to public docs.** Fields that shipped but were not yet documented:
  - `collapse_inserts: true` on the subscribe `conflate` object — collapses in-flight inserts latest-wins; required for last-price throttling on insert-only tick tables (`D-32`).
  - `"whenParamPresent": true` on `and`-clause conditions — predicate is skipped entirely when the caller omits the arg; enables one definition for multi-facet screeners (`D-34`). [Named queries](guides/named-queries.md#optional-predicates-whenparampresent), [browser-tier read limits](guides/browser-tier-read-limits.md#optional-predicates-whenparampresent).
  - `orderByChoices` on the definition + `orderByIndex` in the request — bounded sort choice; caller picks a declared permutation (`D-35`). [Named queries](guides/named-queries.md#bounded-sort-choices-orderbyChoices--orderbyindex).
  - `computed` outputs on `aggregate` materialized queries — physically stored, orderable, first-class columns (`D-36`). [Materialized queries](guides/materialized.md).
  - `dataPlaneAccess: true` on `materializedQueries` schema entries — required for browser reads of MQ result tables; no table-options PATCH (`D-30`).
- **P40 S03 — browser-tier read limits and corrections.** New [What a browser-tier read cannot do](guides/browser-tier-read-limits.md) (operators, `orderBy` types, subscribe refusals, data-plane allowlist generated from the validators). `in` on a partition key documented; `crossPartitionAccess` is not a named-query field; aggregate MQ columns are `outputName`; `offsetParam` / `limitParam` / `distinct` / `count`+`totalMatches` documented; `conflate` caveat on insert-only streams; BL-146 recovery path; BL-176 (`schema diff --access` is C# CLI only).
- **Studio 0.0.18 (P39).** Operator console catches up to server 0.1.8: named-artifact catalog/test/authoring, insert-time unique/derived/checks/`call`/route/tee, `dataPlaneAccess` + `mk_pub_*` + policy inspect, hash subscribe, schema-file MQ maps (BL-174), identity-insert, bulk-load transform-intent copy. Pin `@aouda/client` **0.1.13**. [Studio](guides/studio.md), [Compatibility](clients/compatibility.md).

## 0.1.8 — 2026-08-19

**Three adoption gaps closed.** Server **0.1.8**, `@aouda/client` **0.1.12**, `Aouda.Client` **0.1.8**, Studio **0.0.17** (pin unchanged). See [Compatibility](clients/compatibility.md).

- **Typed subscribe-by-hash (BL-173).** `client.namedQueries.subscribe(hash, args, { conflate })` and `NamedQueries.SubscribeAsync(hash, args, options)` — the data-plane's only streaming path no longer requires hand-rolled WebSocket frames. Returns the same subscription object as table subscribe, so `gap` resume, reconnect, `re_auth`, and `SLOW_CONSUMER` recovery are unchanged. [Named queries](guides/named-queries.md#subscribe-by-hash).
- **Materialized queries in `aouda.schema.json` (BL-174).** Top-level `materializedQueries` map (`latestPerKey`, `aggregate`, `filter`) managed by `schema diff` / `apply` / `export`. **A present map is desired state and drops anything not listed; omitting it leaves MQs unmanaged.** [Schema management](guides/schema-management.md#materialized-queries-in-the-schema-file).
- **String and rounding functions (BL-175).** `ScalarExprNode` gains `type: "call"` with a closed allowlist — `upper`, `lower`, `trim`, `concat`, `substring`, `round`, `roundTo`, `cast` — plus `$upper` … `$cast` operators in the TypeScript `.update()` builder. Normalization can now move out of an ingest service. [Insert-time transforms](guides/insert-transforms.md#call--string-and-rounding-functions), [Bulk mutations](guides/bulk-mutations.md#string-and-rounding-operators).

**New:** [Adopting Aouda in an existing application](guides/adoption.md) — the P37 target architecture for an app that already has a frontend, a gateway, and services: which hops stop earning their keep, an honest SDK coverage table, what direct access does to subscription and quota capacity, and the order to migrate in.

**Corrected:** [Auth architecture](auth/architecture.md) Pattern B described the pre-P37 model — a browser holding `mk_anon_*` and running ad-hoc `table().execute()`. Both are now refused. It documents `mk_pub_*`, the data-plane listener, and named queries.

**Added:** `policy inspect` in [Access-surface diff](guides/access-surface.md) ("what would this user see?"), with a corrected `aouda.identities.json` example — `identities` is an object keyed by name, and grants require `dimension` + `partitionKey` + `accessLevel`. [Insert-time transforms](guides/insert-transforms.md) gains failure semantics: a failed check or unmatched `route` fails **the whole batch**, `route` must be exhaustive, and quarantine is a table plus a catch-all route rather than a built-in dead-letter path. [Client integration](auth/client-integration.md) key tables now list `mk_pub_`.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-08-19

Public docs for **P37 Direct Client Access**: named queries (execute, batch, subscribe-by-hash, codegen), data-plane listener and `mk_pub_*`, insert-time transforms, access-surface diff (`aouda schema diff --access`), and the division-of-responsibility guide. HTTP API v2.3 documents `snapshot_complete`, `gap`, `re_auth`, `values_skipped`, and the credential/listener matrix. OAuth authorization-code + PKCE is **not** documented as available.

Guides: [Named queries](guides/named-queries.md), [Direct client access](guides/direct-client-access.md), [Division of responsibility](guides/division-of-responsibility.md), [Insert-time transforms](guides/insert-transforms.md), [Access-surface diff](guides/access-surface.md), [HTTP API](reference/http-api.md). Server **0.1.7**, `@aouda/client` **0.1.11**, Studio **0.0.17**. See [Compatibility](clients/compatibility.md).

## 0.1.6 — 2026-08-13

Server **0.1.6** treats `MaxTotalRamBytes` as a process RSS ceiling (default ~70% of detected RAM), keeps the write-ahead log bounded, and refuses over-budget ingest with HTTP 503 + `Retry-After`. Studio **0.0.16** shows RSS vs governed budget, reclaimable WAL, and quarantined databases. See [Sizing](guides/sizing.md), [Write durability](guides/write-durability.md), and [Compatibility](clients/compatibility.md).

## ✅ P0 — Core Bootstrap (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-Q1
**Scope:** Engine foundations, encoding, and columnar persistence.

### Highlights
- Introduced **typed identifiers**: `TableId`, `ColumnId`, `SegmentId`, `RowId`, `CommitId`.
- Implemented **encoder framework** (`IEncoder`, `IStringEncoder`) with versioning.
- Added numeric encoders:
  - `Int32DeltaBitpackEncoder`
  - `Int64DeltaBitpackEncoder`
  - `GorillaDoubleEncoder`
- Added `StringDictEncoder` with dictionary compression and varint encoding.
- Created **Page system** (`PageMeta`, `PageStats`, `PageAddress`) with CRC validation.
- Built **FilePageStore** with append-only persistence and page indexing.
- Implemented **QueryEngine v0** (projection, filter, aggregation primitives).
- Established **TableDef**, **ColumnDef**, and schema catalog foundations.

### Result
Aouda became capable of ingesting, encoding, and reading columnar pages fully in-memory and on-disk.

## ✅ P1 — Durability & Recovery (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-Q3
**Scope:** Write-ahead logging, hybrid row buffering, compaction, and crash recovery.

### Highlights
- Added **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** with frame-based append and CRC validation.
- Implemented **WalSegmentWriter** and **WalReplayer** for safe crash recovery.
- Introduced **Hybrid Row Area (HRA)** for in-memory, row-oriented buffering.
- Integrated **HRA snapshotting** into QueryEngine to unify query visibility across memory and disk.
- Added **CompactionWorker** and **RetentionManager** for background flushing and pruning.
- Introduced **Checkpoint system** ensuring consistency between WAL and column pages.
- All major recovery and durability tests now pass, including torn WAL detection.

### Result
Aouda now provides full **durable write semantics** — all data survives process restarts, and WAL replay guarantees correctness.
